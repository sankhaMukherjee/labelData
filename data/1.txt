Knight Rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist. 
Michael Knight, a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
There’s a voice that keeps on calling me. 
Down the road, that’s where I’ll always be. 
Every stop I make, I make a new friend. 
Can’t stay for long, just turn around and I’m gone again. 
Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down, Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.
One for all and all for one, Muskehounds are always ready.
One for all and all for one, helping everybody.
One for all and all for one, it’s a pretty story.
Sharing everything with fun, that’s the way to be.
One for all and all for one, Muskehounds are always ready.
One for all and all for one, helping everybody.
One for all and all for one, can sound pretty corny.
If you’ve got a problem chum, think how it could be.
