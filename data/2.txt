80 days around the world, we’ll find a pot of gold just sitting where the rainbow’s ending.
Time — we’ll fight against the time, and we’ll fly on the white wings of the wind.

Round, round, all around the world.
Round, all around the world.

Birds taught me to sing, when they took me to their king, first I had to fly, in the sky so high so high, so high so high so high, so — if you want to sing this way, think of what you’d like to say, add a tune and you will see, just how easy it can be.
Treacle pudding, fish and chips, fizzy drinks and liquorice, flowers, rivers, sand and sea, snowflakes and the stars are free.
